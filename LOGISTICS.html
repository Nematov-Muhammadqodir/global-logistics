    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Coupang?</h2>
    <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      Coupang, South Korea’s largest e-commerce company, has built one of the most advanced logistics systems in the world. Known for its "Rocket Delivery," Coupang delivers millions of products within hours using its fully in-house supply chain.

    <!-- 1. Raw Material Sourcing -->
    <div class="bg-blue-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Raw Material Sourcing</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang does not produce raw materials itself. Instead, it partners with a wide network of domestic and international suppliers, mainly from South Korea and Southeast Asia. Supplier selection is based on strict quality, pricing, and delivery performance criteria.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 2. Distribution Centers -->
    <div class="bg-green-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Distribution Centers</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang owns over 100 advanced fulfillment and distribution centers across South Korea, located within 10 km of 70% of the population. These centers are operated 24/7 and powered by automation for faster sorting, picking, and packing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Component Manufacturing -->
    <div class="bg-yellow-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Component Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang uses third-party manufacturers for all components and products. However, it works directly with these producers through its vendor management system, ensuring compliance, transparency, and efficient lead times under its Rocket system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. Assembly -->
    <div class="bg-purple-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4. Assembly</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional retailers, Coupang does not require product assembly at a centralized location. Instead, each item is handled individually and prepared for dispatch at the closest fulfillment center, following a decentralized drop-shipping-inspired method.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Quality Control -->
    <div class="bg-red-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">5. Quality Control</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang applies strict quality standards for all products listed on its platform. Customer reviews, return rates, and internal performance metrics help identify underperforming products. Automated systems monitor quality trends in real time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 6. Transportation -->
    <div class="bg-teal-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">6. Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang uses its own logistics fleet called “Coupang Friends” to handle deliveries. This full-time, in-house team ensures punctual, careful, and customer-friendly service. Coupang avoids outsourcing to maintain control and speed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 7. Retail and E-Commerce -->
    <div class="bg-pink-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">7. Retail and E-Commerce</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang sells products through its mobile app and website. With AI-based search and recommendations, the platform ensures a seamless shopping experience. Prices remain competitive due to low overhead and logistics optimization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 8. After-Sales Services -->
    <div class="bg-indigo-100 p-6 rounded-lg fade-in shadow">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">8. After-Sales Services</h3>
      <p>
        Coupang offers a no-questions-asked 30-day return policy for most items. Customers can schedule pickup returns directly from their app. Live chat support is available 24/7, making post-purchase service easy and efficient.
